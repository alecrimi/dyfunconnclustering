This repository comprises the developed code related to the analysis of dynamic functional connectivity for autism and schizophrenia.

It contains the machinelearning scripts, the flexibility index code and the preprocessed time series averaged according to the Harvard-Oxford atlas. The time seies are obtained from two available datasets:
1. COBRE for schizophrenia http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/retro/cobre.html
2. ABIDE2 for autism http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/abide/abide_II.html
